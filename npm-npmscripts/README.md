# NPM + NPM Scripts
- NPM was created for developers to share javascript code
- This code is in the form of packages that can be found on the NPM Registry
- Called packages or modules
- Each package contains two things:
  - package.json file: A meta file that describes this package
  - js file: Contains the actual javascript code that can be reused
- The idea is to have small files that do one thing really well so other people can use it
- A coder then composes or combines these bits of code with their project to add functionaity
- You can find useful packages at [(https://www.npmjs.com/)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Beware
  - Can add bytes to your code
  - Code may not be well written. Anyone can submit a package.
- Yarn is another place you can get javascript code packages and is basically the same as NPM
- 3 types of NPM scripts
  - Front end browser
  - Command line
  - Back end Node.js
- There are 3 must do things to do when starting any web dev project:
  - Have HTML + CSS + Javascript files
  - Have project on Github Repo + Git
  - Manage dependencies or packages with NPM using Package.json file
- Node.js
  - Created to run javascript outside of the browser
  - Installing Node.js automatically installs NPM package manager for us
